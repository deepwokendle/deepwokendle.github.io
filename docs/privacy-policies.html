                <strong>Deepwokendle</strong> is a fan-made guessing game inspired by the Roblox game
                <em>Deepwoken</em>.
                All credit for the original game and its content goes to the respective creators and rights holders of
                <em>Deepwoken</em>. Deepwokendle is an independent project and is not affiliated with the original
                developers.

            <h2>Advertising</h2>
            <p>
                We use <strong>Google AdSense</strong> to display advertisements on this site. Google and other
                third-party
                advertising providers may use cookies and similar technologies to serve and personalize ads. You can opt
                out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads"
                    class="underscoreAnimation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Settings</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies are small text files stored on your device to help the site function and to improve your user
                experience. On Deepwokendle cookies may be used for basic site functionality, remembering simple
                preferences, and allowing advertising partners to deliver ads. We do not actively use cookies ourselves
                for advanced tracking or profiling beyond what third-party services (such as ad networks) may set.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services &amp; Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>
                Deepwokendle itself collects minimal information. The only user-provided data we store is a
                <strong>username</strong>
                and a <strong>hashed password</strong> (used strictly to allow you to log in). We do not require
                or store email addresses, phone numbers, or other personally identifying information for account
                creation.
                We do not believe we use user data for any other purpose beyond providing the login feature and basic
                site functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, third-party services used on this site (for example Google AdSense, hosting providers, or
                analytics
                tools) may collect additional information about your visit independently (such as IP address, device and
                browser information, or cookies). Those third parties control their own data practices — please consult
                their privacy policies for details.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Choices</h2>
            <p>
                If you prefer not to have cookies stored by third parties, you can disable or delete cookies through
                your
                browser settings — note that disabling cookies may affect some site features or ad personalization.
                To opt out of personalized ads, use the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads"
                    class="underscoreAnimation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Settings</a> page.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to request access to the account data we store (your username) or ask for removal of your
                account
                and associated hashed password, contact us (see the Contact section). We will respond to reasonable
                requests
                to delete or export data associated with your account where technically possible.
            </p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                We take basic measures to protect stored account credentials (for example, storing passwords hashed
                rather
                than in plain text). No security setup is perfect — if you believe your account has been compromised,
                contact us immediately and change any credentials you may have reused elsewhere.
            </p>

            <p>
